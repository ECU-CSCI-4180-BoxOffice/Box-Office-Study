# Box Office Study
This is our data science project on finding out if hiring "big name actors" results in having a higher grossing movie.

## Hypothesis
We think that “big name actors” are correlated with more sales in the box office. This Alteryx project is going to help us find out.

## How to use
Make sure to add the necessary data files to the "data" folder.

The .tsv files from the IMDB dataset are necessary to add manually due to file size restrictions on GitHub.
