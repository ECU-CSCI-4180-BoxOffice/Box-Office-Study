# Box Office Study
This is our data science project on finding out if hiring "big name actors" results in having a higher grossing movie.

## Hypothesis
We want to find out which genre will lead to the most revenue, and any significant outliers which are pushing a specific genre.

## How to use
Make sure to add the necessary data files to the "data" folder.

The .tsv files from the IMDB dataset are necessary to add manually due to file size restrictions on GitHub.
